I would like to firstly thank God for pulling me through a very busy and strenuous semester. To my family back in Pretoria, thank you for your calls and your patience - I have finally reached the end of this beautiful road. To my supervisor, Dr Yunus Abdul Patel, thank you so much for your advice, recommendations, and overall \emph{patience} with me this semester. I could not have done this without you.

To Nthabi - what a blessing - thank you for holding me down this semester. Thank you for lending my your time, laptop, patience, shoulder, and for essentially doing this with me. I appreciate all your time and effort. To Zoe, thank you for always checking up on me and allowing me to work in your room when I could not find the motivation. To all my friends, I love you all to the moon and back.
